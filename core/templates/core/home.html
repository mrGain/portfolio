                <i>I am <b class="text-warning">Rakesh Gain</b> ,I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I
                have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to
                challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught
                myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to
                person for any design.</i> <br></p>

                <i>Im a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives
                and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people
                feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with
                new clients. In my previous job, my clientsâ€™ customer satisfaction scores were 15 percent over the
                company average.</i>
